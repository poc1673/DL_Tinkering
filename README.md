## Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to act as a record/holding piece for my continued reading/development on neural networks. I've currently broken it into three subsections:


# Structure of Project


* Etudes - Exercises with machine learning.
* Data - Data-sets to be hosted locally for the purpose of the work.
* Papers - Papers that are reviewed as resources. Formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.
